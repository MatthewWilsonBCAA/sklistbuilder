        >This is a 2 player game, although rules may be tweaked to account for 3
        or more. Players will need a tape measure/ruler that can measure in
        inches, at least one ten-sided dice (called a D10), a table to play on
        (any size will work, although 48&rdquo; x 48&rdquo; is recommended,
        since this is the size the game will be balanced around), and the rules
        for the models you plan to play with. Outside of that, for recommended
        equipment, plastic tokens and a dry erasable marker are recommended,
        along with a scratch piece of paper to track scoring, although not
        required.</span

      <span  
        >On top of the dice and measuring tool, each player will need a set of
        miniatures that the rule set refers to as &ldquo;Models&rdquo;. Each
        Model represents a character within the game. A character within the
        game will have a rule set (sometimes called a &ldquo;card&rdquo;) that
        lists their various statistics, and abilities (covered in Section 2).
        Each player should bring an army of equal Point Values, equating to the
        total number of points between the cards of all models they will be
        playing with. More details will be present in Section 3, on how to
        assemble an army of models.</span

        (books, sheets of construction paper, or printed/purchased terrain made
        for Wargaming), and they provide special rules depending on their
        qualities. Terrain may be arranged on the table in whatever way you and
        your opponent wish. If you cannot decide or simply prefer to, you may
        instead each roll a D10, and whoever has the higher roll sets up terrain
        (re-roll ties).</span

        Models can walk through forests freely. When drawing Line of Sight, if
        both models are outside of the forest, treat the forest as if it blocks
        Line of Sight completely (like an Obstruction). If one or both of the
        models are inside the forest, ignore the forest for Line of Sight unless
        there is more than 3&rdquo; of forest between both models. If there is
        more than 3&rdquo; of forest between the models, treat it as if it
        blocks Line of Sight completely. Any model wholly within Forests gains
        concealment.</span
