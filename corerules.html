Stardust Kingdoms: Red Rain
1 - Setting up the game
1.1 Basic Requirements
This is a 2 player game, although rules may be tweaked to account for 3 or more. Players will need a tape measure/ruler that can measure in inches, at least one ten-sided dice (called a D10), a table to play on (any size will work, although 48” x 48” is recommended, since this is the size the game will be balanced around), and the rules for the models you plan to play with. Outside of that, for recommended equipment, plastic tokens and a dry erasable marker are recommended, along with a scratch piece of paper to track scoring, although not required.
1.2 Models
On top of the dice and measuring tool, each player will need a set of miniatures that the rule set refers to as “Models”. Each Model represents a character within the game. A character within the game will have a rule set (sometimes called a “card”) that lists their various statistics, and abilities (covered in Section 2). Each player should bring an army of equal Point Values, equating to the total number of points between the cards of all models they will be playing with. More details will be present in Section 3, on how to assemble an army of models.
1.3 Table and Terrain
When setting up the table in which you and your opponent will play on, some objects will be placed called Terrain. These can be anything (books, sheets of construction paper, or printed/purchased terrain made for Wargaming), and they provide special rules depending on their qualities. Terrain may be arranged on the table in whatever way you and your opponent wish. If you cannot decide or simply prefer to, you may instead each roll a D10, and whoever has the higher roll sets up terrain (re-roll ties).





2 - Models/Characters
2.1 Basic Characteristics
Every model card has a set number of characteristics assigned to it:
Name
Base Size
Wounds
Movement
Guard
Willpower
Fight
Arcane
Weapons
Spells
Abilities
Keywords
Points
2.2 Base Size
This characteristic is the size, in millimeters, of the base the model stands on.
2.3 Wounds
This characteristic determines how many Wounds a model can take before it starts Bleeding Out.
2.4 Movement
This characteristic determines how far, in inches, a model can move across the table in one turn.
2.5 Guard
This characteristic determines the value in which a model needs to roll to block a Hit from an incoming weapon.
2.6 Willpower
This characteristic determines the value in which a model needs to roll to ignore the effects of an incoming spell.
2.7 Fight
This characteristic determines how many times this model can use a weapon in one turn.
2.8 Arcane
This characteristic determines how many spells this model can cast spells. 
2.9 Weapons
This is a list of weaponry, both melee and ranged, in which this model can use. Unless stated otherwise, a model may only use their melee OR ranged weapons in one turn.
2.10 Spells
This is a list of spells in which this model can cast at any point during its turn. 
2.11 Abilities
This is a list of both passive and invokable rules which are applied to this model.
2.12 Keywords
This is a list of Keywords, in which some rules require a model to have for the effects to apply to them.
2.12.1 Generic Keywords
Battleline: These are models in which are usually generic soldiers.
Leader: These are usually important models that lead your army into battle.
Behemoth: These models are much larger, creature-like models.
Flying: These models can move over the top of any terrain piece without having the effects of it being applied to them.
Spectral: Acts the same as Flying.
Unique: These models are unique characters. Only 1 of them can be in an army.
2.13 Points
This is a value which goes into adding this model in a list. 







3 - Building an list
3.1 Point Maximum
Before setting up the table, players should build a list of models in which they will bring. Players should set a cap for their list of models, and both build a list close to or equal to that cap (125 points is recommended).
3.2 Factions
When building a list of models, you must also pick a faction in which your list will belong to. When assembling your list, you must select models that share a faction keyword. For example, if you wish to play as a Wormwood Legion list, your models must have the “Wormwood Legion” keyword. However, you can include Mercenary models within your list. Mercenary models are models in which either belong to another faction, or are factionless models. At most, 1 in 3 of the models you bring can be Mercenary. If you go over this limit, you become a Factionless list, and cannot benefit from the benefits selecting a particular faction would otherwise give you. Also note some models have the Loyalist keyword. Models with the Loyalist keyword cannot be used in any faction except the one listed on their card, nor can they be used in a Factionless list. 
3.3 Model Requirements
When building a list of models, you must include at least 1 model with the Leader Keyword (or simply 1 Leader Model) and 3 models with the Battleline Keyword (or simply 3 Battleline Models).
3.4 Specialist Cards
Whenever you select a model, you may choose to give it a Specialist Card. These cards add or change rules for that model. Note some models can only take particular Specialist cards, or none at all. A faction can provide Specialist Cards unique to them, or a model can simply select one of the Generic Specialist Cards, listed below.
3.4.1 Combat Medic
When a model has this card, it can make the following Action:

Patch Up (Activates on 5): Target one friendly model within 3” of this model. The model stands up with 1 Wound, and is no longer Bleeding Out.
3.4.2 Skirmisher
When a model has this card, it may roll a D6 before attacking. On a 4+, the model gains +1 to Hit Rolls for the rest of its turn. This effect may only be invoked once per turn.
3.4.3 Rallier
When a model has this card, it can make the following Action:

Rally (Activates on 5): All friendly models within 8” of this model at any point of their turn can re-roll Charge Rolls for that turn. 
3.5 Units
Some models can have the option to be placed in a “Unit”. Models within a unit activate at the same time, but carry out their actions and movement separately from each other. If you decide to place multiple models within a unit, they must all take the same Specialist Card(s). A model will have the Max Unit Size characteristic listed on its card, if it can be placed in a unit. Note that a model must be placed in a Unit of models that are all of the same model card (for example, an Royal Estojian Guardsman cannot be placed in a unit with an Estojian Skirmisher).
4 - Starting off the game
4.1 Picking an Objective
Once you and your opponent have set up the Terrain for the game (the process from Section 1.3), then you may select an Objective for you and your opponent to play. Note that you and your opponent may select the Objective first, as to build the terrain around whatever Objective is selected. To select an Objective, you and your opponent may select one of the following from the list below, or each roll a D10 (re-rolling ties) and the winner of that roll selects the objective.

4.1.1 Head-to-Head

Player A Deployment


Player B Deployment


The simplest objective in the game. Players gain victory points equal to the point value of any model in which they remove from play. After 3 Rounds, whoever has the most victory points wins the game.
4.1.2 Capture the Flag

Player A Deployment


Flag


Player B Deployment
Player A Deployment






Player B Deployment
Player A Deployment


Goal


Player B Deployment

In this objective, players attempt to grab the flag with one of their models and carry it to the goal post. The flag should be a model on a 30mm, 40mm, or 50mm base. Whenever a model is within 1” of the flag, they can “pick up” the flag. While a model is holding the flag, remove it from play. If a model that is holding the flag is Knocked Down or removed from play, the player who controls the model that was holding it selects a point 3” away from the knocked down model, and places the flag there. If there is not a valid position for the flag to be placed in this manner, treat it as if the model who was holding is now the current position of the flag. Whichever player gets a model holding the flag within 3” of the Goal wins the game.
4.1.3 Domination

Objective


Player B Deployment

In this objective, players attempt to control Objectives. Objectives can be represented by any object, as long as it isn’t obnoxiously large (for example, don’t use a 12” plank of wood to represent an Objective). At the end of each round, players score points equal to the number of models within 6” of an Objective. Behemoth models are worth 2 points.


4.2 Deploying Models
Once an Objective is selected, players both roll a D10 (re-rolling ties), and the player with the higher roll may either pick which deployment zone they want, or order of deployment. Whichever option they do not select becomes their opponent’s. First, the player who is picking their deployment zone selects one. Then, the player who is picking the order of deployment. When deploying, unless the objective specifies otherwise, players must place their models wholly within 10” of the table edge. Whoever deploys last gets to go first.
5 - Rounds
5.1 Starting a round
At the start of a round, both players select the order in which their units will activate via cards. Players shouldn’t reveal the order they pick for their units. Once both players have selected their units, they place them down and do not change their order. Then, both players roll a D10 (re-rolling ties). Whoever has the highest roll flips the first card, and activates the unit.

5.2 Movement
During the activation/turn of a model, the model may first opt to make a movement. During this, you may place the model in a position wholly within a distance less than or equal to their Movement characteristic, as long as the path to the position selected does not overlap with any Obstructions or models (for example, you could not move a 50mm based model through a 25mm gap). Note that you can move multiple times, as long as the total distance is less than or equal to the model’s Movement characteristic. For example, a model with the movement of 5 could move 3” in one direction, then 2” in another direction, in an attempt to get around an obstacle.

If two models of opposing sides are at a distance in which either model can reach the other with a valid Melee Weapon, the models are deemed to be In Combat. While models are in combat, they cannot make a normal movement to leave it, only make movements to get closer to the model they are in combat with, unless they perform a Retreat Action, listed in 5.3.3.

During a movement that does not happen in the same turn as a Run, a model may use Arcane to cast Spells, as covered in Section 6.6.

5.3 Actions
After moving the model whatever distance you wish within the limits, then you can select 1 Action for that model to take. Outside of Special Actions listed on model’s card, there are Generic Actions a model can take: 
Attack with Melee Weapons
Attack with Ranged Weapons
Grab a Flag/Objective Marker
Run
Charge into using weapons
Retreat
Take Cover (can only be invoked by certain terrain, see 7.1.3)
Note that, unless an Ability lists otherwise, a model can only make 1 Action per turn. Note also that, unless an Ability lists otherwise, Ranged Weapons cannot be used while a model within 3” of a hostile model. Once an Action is resolved, the model’s activation ends.

If a Special Action lists a value in the format of “Activates on [value]”, you must roll D10, and the ability only applies if the result of the dice is greater than or equal to the value of the activation. If not, it fails, and the Action ends.
5.3.1 Running
A model can use their action to Run. When running, the model may make another full movement. Note that, for keeping the game concise, you may simply declare a Run at the beginning of a model’s activation, and double their movement during that singular movement. However, this still counts as the Action for the model’s turn.
5.3.2 Charging
A model can use their action to Charge. When charging, roll a D10 (called a Charge Roll, for rules purposes). The range of the charge becomes the result of the dice in inches, capped at the Movement characteristic of the model. For example, if a Charge Roll results in a 7, but the model making it has a Movement characteristic of 5, the final result of the roll becomes 5. If there is a hostile model within distance of the range of the charge plus the range of their farthest reaching melee weapon (or 1”, if they do not have a melee weapon), the charge is a success, and the charging model makes a full movement equal to the range of the charge directly towards the target. Then, they may use one of the Attack Actions. Note that if the charging model cannot make the full movement due to distance or Terrain, they make the full movement as if they succeeded, but then their activation ends.


5.3.3 Retreating
A model can use their action to Retreat. Retreats can only be made if a model is in combat with another model. When retreating, a model can make a movement equal to their Movement characteristic plus the result of D3 + 3”. When a retreat is declared however, any models that were in combat with them can opt to use a singular melee weapon that has range on the target model. When making this free attack, hostile models gain +1 to Hit.
5.4 End of a turn
Once a model’s activation is over, the opposite player then flips a card and activates the listed unit. If the opposite player has no models to activate, then the turn goes back to the current player. If neither player has models left to activate, then the round ends, and both players convene to calculate victory points, check for any effects that happen at the end of the round, and determine if the victory condition has been met for their objective. Note that the game also ends at the end of the 7th Round, unless an Objective specifies otherwise.
6 - Attacks
6.1 Resolving Attacks
When the action of the model invokes an Attack, then the combat cycle initiates. To begin, a model must have at least one ranged or melee weapon within range of and Line of Sight (defined in Section 7.1.1) on the model they wish to attack. After an attack is declared, the attacking model either selects ranged weapons OR all melee weapons to use. Then, they select weapons to use based on how many Fight points they have, listed on their card. One Fight Point equals one use of a weapon. If a model has enough fight to use all of its weapons of a category (Melee or Ranged), it must use all of them at least once.
6.2 Using Weapons
When using a weapon, roll D10 (called a Hit Roll), along with +1 to the roll, if this is the first weapon being used after a successful Charge. If the result of the dice is greater than or equal to the Hit value of the weapon, the weapon’s attack is successful, and the target must make a Guard Roll. If a successful attack is made on a roll with an unmodified 10, the target does not make a Guard Roll, and instead takes the damage as if it is Decisive Wounds. Hit Rolls of a 10 count as always hitting, in spite of any modifiers. If a Hit Roll is an unmodified 1, the attack fails, in spite of any modifiers.
6.2.1 Decisive Wounds
Decisives Wounds are applied as damage to a model as normal, though the Guard Roll is bypassed. Note that Wards are still made.
6.3 Guard and Damage
If an attack lands on a target, the target model rolls a D10 (called a Guard Roll). Then, subtract the rend value on the weapon from the dice’s result (For example, if the dice lands on 8, and the weapon has -2 Rend, the result becomes 6). If the result of the roll is greater than or equal to the target’s Guard Roll, the attack is negated, and no damage is taken. If the Guard Roll is not passed, however, subtract the damage from the target’s wound value. If the target is left with zero, they are Knocked Down and are put into the Bleed Out state. If a model is hit with damage that would put its current wound value below zero, the model is instead removed from play immediately (for example, if a 1 Wound model takes 2 damage, it is now at -1 Wounds. In that case, simply remove it from play). Note that if a model is attacked and fails a Guard Roll while at zero wounds, it is removed from play. If a successful guard is made on a roll with an unmodified 10, the target who was attacked may select one of its weapons that are valid to use in the current range, and make a free attack with it. An unmodified Guard Roll of 10 counts as succeeding, in spite of any modifiers. If a Guard Roll is an unmodified 1, the guard fails, in spite of any modifiers.
6.3.1 Ward
Some models have a special ability called a “Ward” on them. For every point of damage you would allocate to them, roll a D10. If the result of that dice is greater than or equal to the model’s Ward, ignore that point of damage.
6.4 Bleed Out
While a model is in a Bleed Out state, they must make a Bleed Out Roll at the start of its activation. To make this roll, first a model rolls a D10. Then, consult the following chart to see what happens:

Result of the D10
Effect
1, 2, 3, or 4
The model is removed from play
5, 6, 7, 8, or 9
The model takes a Auto-Hit 1 Damage Hit
10
The model loses Bleed Out and stands up

Note that if a model takes any damage while Bleeding Out, they are immediately removed from play, since that would reduce its wound count below zero, as covered in 6.3.


6.5 Knocked Down
While a model is Knocked Down, they cannot perform any movement, actions, or abilities during their activation. If they are not also Bleeding Out, they can roll D10 (called a Willpower Check). If the result of the dice is greater than or equal to the model’s Willpower, they lose the Knocked Down status, standing up. After a model stands up, their movement for this turn is treated as an Action, and will immediately end their turn if taken. When a Knocked Down model is targeted by an attack, the attacking model bypasses their Hit Roll, and the downed model immediately makes a Guard Roll against the attack, with -1 to their rolls, and 10s do not grant a free attack.
6.6 Spell Casting
At any point during the activation, before taking an Action, a model may spend Arcane to cast a spell (the cost defaults to 1, if it is not listed). First, a spell must be declared. Then, to cast the spell, the caster rolls a D10. This is called a Casting Roll. If the value of the roll is greater than or equal to the listed casting value (formatted as “Casts on [value]”), then the spell is successful, and the ability listed can be applied.

Note some spells specify range, and the distance between the caster and a target must be less than or equal to the specified range. Also note that, unless stated otherwise, a caster must have Line of Sight on a model it wishes to apply a spell effect to.
7 - Terrain
Terrain are objects placed on the table, to help break Line of Sight between models, or add special rules for models to interact with. 
7.1 Special Rules
7.1.1 Line of Sight
Line of Sight is the ability for one model to see another model. If you can draw an imaginary line between the bases of two models that does not intersect with any Obstructions, other models, or other terrain that act like Obstructions, then Line of Sight is met. Otherwise, it is not met.
7.1.2 Concealment
When a model has Concealment, models targeting it with Melee and Ranged weapons have -1 to the results of Hit Rolls they make. This effect can only be applied to a model once at any given moment.
7.1.3 Cover
When a model has Cover, it has +1 to the results of Guard Rolls it makes. This effect can only be applied to a model once at any given moment. 

Some terrain pieces can invoke this effect, via the following Generic Action:

Take Cover: This model gains Cover, if Line of Sight must be drawn through the Short Wall this model interacted with. This Cover lasts until the beginning of the model’s next turn.
7.2 Obstructions
Obstructions are solid objects which exist to block Line of Sight. Also, models cannot move through them. Flying and Spectral models can move through them, but cannot land on top of them.
7.3 Partial Walls
Partial Walls (or Partial Fences) can have Line of Sight drawn through them, but otherwise behave like Obstructions. If Line of Sight must be drawn through a Partial Wall for a Melee or Ranged attack, the target model gains Concealment during the Action being made.
7.3.1 Short Walls
Short Walls behave like a Partial Walls. However, if a model is within 1” of a Short Wall, they can take the Take Cover action, listed in 7.1.3.
7.4 Forests
Forests are a piece of terrain which represent a cluster of trees. Models can walk through forests freely. When drawing Line of Sight, if both models are outside of the forest, treat the forest as if it blocks Line of Sight completely (like an Obstruction). If one or both of the models are inside the forest, ignore the forest for Line of Sight unless there is more than 3” of forest between both models. If there is more than 3” of forest between the models, treat it as if it blocks Line of Sight completely. Any model wholly within Forests gains concealment.
7.5 Water
Water terrain is a piece of terrain representing a shallow body of water. Unless a model is Flying or Spectral, its Movement is halved while moving through it. Water does not block Line of Sight.
7.6 Portal
Portals are pieces of terrain in which magically move models from one point to another. Portals come in pairs. Each Portal in a pair allows models to make the following action: 

Jump in Portal: Target one Portal Terrain within 1” of this model. Pick up and place this model within 3” of the Portal paired with this one, and at least 6” away from any hostile models. This action cannot be used if the secondary placement cannot be completed. 
7.7 Movable Object
This tag can be applied to smaller Obstructions, Partial Walls, or Short Walls. If one of those terrain pieces is declared to be Movable, models within 1” of it can make the following action: 

Push Around: Target one Movable Object within 1” of this model. Pick up and place both this model and the Movable Object, and place them wholly within 5” of where they originally were. If the Movable Object is a Short Wall, this model can immediately make a Take Cover action after this action.

Writer’s Notes
Formula to calculate a model’s baseline point cost:

(Wounds x 2) + Movement + (10 - Guard) + (10 - Will) + Fight + (Arcane x 2) + (Spell Count x 3) + ((10 - Ward) x 2)
